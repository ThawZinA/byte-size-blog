# Getting Started with React

React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. In this post, we'll explore the basics of React and create your first component.

## What is React?

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "components."

## Your First Component

Here's a simple React component:

\`\`\`jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}
\`\`\`

This component accepts a single "props" object argument with data and returns a React element.

## Key Concepts

- **Components**: The building blocks of React applications
- **JSX**: A syntax extension for JavaScript
- **Props**: How data flows between components
- **State**: How components manage their own data

React makes it easy to create interactive UIs with its component-based architecture.
