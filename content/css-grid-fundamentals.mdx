# CSS Grid Fundamentals

CSS Grid is a powerful layout system that allows you to create complex, responsive layouts with ease. Let's explore the fundamentals.

## Basic Grid Setup

To create a grid container, use `display: grid`:

\`\`\`css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: auto;
  gap: 1rem;
}
\`\`\`

## Grid Areas

You can define named grid areas for more semantic layouts:

\`\`\`css
.layout {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header header"
    "sidebar main main"
    "footer footer footer";
}
\`\`\`

## Responsive Grids

CSS Grid works beautifully with media queries for responsive design:

\`\`\`css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }
}
\`\`\`

CSS Grid gives you precise control over both rows and columns, making it perfect for complex layouts.
